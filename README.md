# PokeBattleHD
Welcome to the official GitHub page for PokeBattleHD, an HD pokemon battle simulator!
This project is built in Unity using the High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for physically-based material simulation.
The current goal of this project is to add as many pokemon and moves to PokeBattleHD as possible.
